/*
Two types of npm dependies are there

1. Regular Dependencies: At which our app depends (like React, next, tailwind etc)
Syntax: npm i <dependencyName> (like "npm i express")

2. Development Dependencies: Our app doesn't depend on them but we use them to increase productivity like (nodemon for autosave etc)
Syntax: npm i <dependencyName> --save-dev (like "npm i nodemon --save-dev")


We've two types of packages while working with npm

1. Local: Only accessible where installed
Syntax: (Same common like "npm i express" for local dependency OR "npm i nodemon --save-dev" for global dependency)

1. Local: Accessible everywhere
Syntax: (like "npm i -g express" for local dependency OR "npm i -g nodemon --save-dev" for global dependency)
